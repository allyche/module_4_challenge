## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

1. [pandas] (https://pandas.pydata.org/) a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. 
2. [pathlib] The pathlib is a standard module. Path is the core object to work with files.
3. [%matplotlib inline] The chart plotting command. The output of plotting commands is displayed inline within frontends like the Jupyter notebook, directly below the code cell that produced it. The resulting plots will then also be stored in the notebook document.
4. [numpy] (https://numpy.org/) NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
